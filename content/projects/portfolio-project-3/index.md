# Robot Operational Control (ROC)

## Summary
In 2018 I had the pleasure of working on a project for United Rentals with Fresh Consulting. It was a desktop web app, intended to be run on tablets on-site in construction projects. It was an Electron web app with a SQLite backend, and a GraphQL interface between.

## Details
I worked on this project for a year. It was my first professional project out of college, and it was a blast! I got my hands dirty with React and Javascript for the first time. Many lessons learned and late nights as sometimes the work needed to get done but I wasn't quite up to snuff on some parts of software development. I had incredible mentors, team leads, and PMs on this project though, so everything always went smoothly.

The highlight of this project was going to Florida for a week to work on-site at a solar panel installation as they were building it. We tested the track loaders and used the software that I and my team were building in real time. The only downside was that it was over 100 degrees every day. We were in a small, old house for 12 hours a day, and throughout the day the AC was overcome to the point that by dinner it was almost the same temperature inside as outside.
