summary: An introduction to my summer in Arizona, after graduating High School

---
{{< load-photoswipe >}}

I actually arrived in Arizona on the 15th, so I&#8217;m just finishing up a week here, but I&#8217;m just getting around to starting this blog off now. It&#8217;s crazy to believe that I graduated exactly a week before I left. There&#8217;s so many options &#8211; paths in life &#8211; available to me now that it&#8217;s almost too hard to choose. Thankfully, I already have this job at the Grand Canyon lined up, and unless something goes wrong, I&#8217;ll be kept busy till October. I&#8217;m also thinking about applying to one or two ski resorts for the winter (definitely Snowbird), and that would probably fill another three months. I would like to be home for Christmas, though, and I&#8217;ll need to start applying to colleges after that.

Since I arrived, I&#8217;ve gone up to Snowbowl, Flagstaff&#8217;s ski resort/pass, and ridden the chair lift up to 11,500 feet, the highest I&#8217;ve ever gone, I believe (a lot compared to ol&#8217; Steven&#8217;s Pass at 4000 feet). I&#8217;ve gone to the Grand Canyon and toured the south rim from the visitor&#8217;s center out to Hermit&#8217;s Rest. I also went geocaching with my siblings, and found all three that we went for! Has to be a record &#8211; we haven&#8217;t had a good previous record of actually finding them.

For graduation I got a new camera, which, though it&#8217;s a Costco camera, it&#8217;s better than any camera I&#8217;ve ever seen/had. Have some photos:
